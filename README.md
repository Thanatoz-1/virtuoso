# Virtuoso
> Named Entity BOI tagger for everyone

In this project we are going to create a Named Entity Tagger and Generator tool for creating your own synthetic dataset. Feel free to talk about different styles of creating the dataset if find my idea invalid. This will be a python script that could be used to enter the templates in text format and then generate CSV files from the same templates. 

Targetted input formats
```bash
python virtuso.py templates/template1.txt generated/generated1.txt ner
```
